# Introduction

```
```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

Welcome to the JAPI documentation website! Here you can find out how to use our API to the best of your needs!

Some of our routes require a [JAPI Key](https://key.japi.rest) to be passed in the header of the request. They are used to identify the user and to restrict access to certain routes. You can register your own key [here](https://key.japi.rest).

<!-- <aside class="warning">
  JAPI is still in early development and is not suitable for production environments!
